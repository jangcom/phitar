# EXFOR excitation functions

* The excitation functions in this directory have all been retrieved from
  the [ENDF database of EXFOR](https://www-nds.iaea.org/exfor/endf.htm).
* For compatibility with phitar, the IAEA-Med-2019 data
  have been augmented by phitar utility programs
  [xsconv](https://github.com/jangcom/phitar/tree/master/utils/xsconv/xsconv.py)
  and [xsaug](https://github.com/jangcom/phitar/tree/master/utils/xsaug/xsaug.py).
