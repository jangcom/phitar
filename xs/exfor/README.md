# EXFOR excitation functions

* The excitation functions in this directory have all been retrieved from
  the [EXFOR library](https://www-nds.iaea.org/exfor/exfor.htm).
* For compatibility with phitar, the data
  have been augmented by phitar utility programs
  [xsconv](https://github.com/jangcom/phitar/tree/master/utils/xsconv/xsconv.py)
  and [xsaug](https://github.com/jangcom/phitar/tree/master/utils/xsaug/xsaug.py).
